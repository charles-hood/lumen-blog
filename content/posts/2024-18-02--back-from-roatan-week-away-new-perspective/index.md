# Back from Roatán: A Week Away, A New Perspective

Returning from a week in Roatán, I've noticed a few things that shed light on how a short break can change your perspective on home:

## Feeling the Chill

After basking in Roatán's warmth, the 47º F temperature back home feels surprisingly cold. It's amusing how quickly my definition of "chilly" has shifted.

## Order in Traffic

Roatán's roads lack the structure and rules we're accustomed to at home. Suddenly, the traffic here seems notably organized, emphasizing the contrast.

## Haste in Restaurants

The leisurely pace of Roatán's restaurants is replaced by the speedy service back home. Ordering, food delivery, and settling the bill happen swiftly, giving a sense of being rushed compared to the island's laid-back vibe.

## Yearning for the Ocean View

The ability to gaze at the ocean from our porch in Roatán, even when not at the beach, creates a unique atmosphere. Now, surrounded by winter's monotone brown scenery at home, I find myself missing that vibrant blue view.

## Realizing Culture Shock

These observations highlight the reality of culture shock, illustrating how a week away unveils fresh perspectives on familiar surroundings. Has this ever happened to you after returning from vacation? What are the things you noticed more when you got home?
