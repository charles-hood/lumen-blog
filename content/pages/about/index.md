Hey there! 👋 I'm a tech enthusiast in my 50s, living in either "Atlanta" or Woodstock, GA &mdash; depending on who's asking. My passions include tech, live music, and exploring new places through travel.

## Techie Adventures 💻

As a tech enthusiast, I love diving into the latest gadgets, coding projects, and exploring the ever-evolving tech landscape. From tinkering with new software to embracing the latest tech trends, I'm always up for a digital adventure.

## Musical Tastes 🎶

**Small venues, big passion.** There's something truly magical about experiencing music in a space where the energy is palpable and the connection between artists and audience is undeniable. That's where I thrive.

**Supporting local artists is a priority for me.** I'm convinced that some of the most talented musicians are right here in our communities, and I'm committed to championing their voices.

## Adventures Beyond Borders ✈️

Travel is another passion of mine. Exploring new places, meeting interesting people, and immersing myself in the beauty of different landscapes—these adventures beyond borders fuel my curiosity.
